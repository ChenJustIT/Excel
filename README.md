# Excel Project: Analyzing GDP Data from Wealth of Nations Dataset with some main functions on Excel

In this GitHub repository, I demonstrate my proficiency with Microsoft Excel by working with the GDP sheet of the Wealth of Nations Excel dataset. I have highlighted various essential Excel functions, including password protection, data formatting, table creation, data filtering, chart creation, chart customization, sheet management, data sorting, and colour the background.

## Project Functions

1. **Set a Password to Protect the Workbook:** To ensure data security, I have added a password to protect the workbook. This prevents unauthorized access to sensitive information.

2. **Change Data Display to British Pound Symbol:** I have formatted column C to display data in British Pound symbols, making it easier to interpret the values.

3. **Turn the GDP Sheet into a Table:** I converted the GDP sheet into an Excel table, which enhances data management, sorting, and filtering capabilities.

4. **Filter the Table for the Year 2019:** I applied a filter to the table to display only the data related to the year 2019, making it easier to focus on a specific time period.

5. **Create a Chart:** I generated a chart that displays specific data points, including 'Rank,' 'Country,' and 'GDP - per capita (PPP).' The chart is visually informative and suitable for data exploration.

9. **Create a New Bar Chart for the Top 20 Countries:** I created a bar chart to display the top 20 highest-ranking countries, and I placed it underneath the table for better data representation.
