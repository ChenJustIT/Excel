# Excel Project: Analyzing GDP Data from Wealth of Nations Dataset with some functions on Excel

In this GitHub repository, I demonstrate my proficiency with Microsoft Excel by working with the GDP sheet of the Wealth of Nations Excel dataset. I have highlighted various essential Excel functions, including password protection, data formatting, table creation, data filtering, chart creation, chart customization, sheet management, data sorting, and colour the background.

## Project Functions

1. **Set a Password to Protect the Workbook:** To ensure data security, I have added a password to protect the workbook. This prevents unauthorized access to sensitive information.

2. **Change Data Display to British Pound Symbol:** I have formatted column C to display data in British Pound symbols, making it easier to interpret the values.

3. **Turn the GDP Sheet into a Table:** I converted the GDP sheet into an Excel table, which enhances data management, sorting, and filtering capabilities.

4. **Filter the Table for the Year 2019:** I applied a filter to the table to display only the data related to the year 2019, making it easier to focus on a specific time period.

5. **Create a Chart:** I generated a chart that displays specific data points, including 'Rank,' 'Country,' and 'GDP - per capita (PPP).' The chart is visually informative and suitable for data exploration.

6. **Chart Customization:** I creatively customized the chart by adding a title, X and Y axis labels, and making it visually pleasing and informative.

7. **Move the Chart to a New Sheet Tab:** I moved the chart to a new sheet tab and labeled it appropriately, ensuring organized and easy access to the visualization.

8. **Create a Sort for the Top 20 Highest Ranking Countries:** I applied sorting to the data to identify and highlight the top 20 highest-ranking countries based on specific criteria.

9. **Create a New Bar Chart for the Top 20 Countries:** I created a bar chart to display the top 20 highest-ranking countries, and I placed it underneath the table for better data representation.

10. **Color the Background Underneath the Table:** I added a background color to the area beneath the table. To do this, you can find the "add a fill color" icon and select a suitable color.

I continue to demonstrate my proficiency with Microsoft Excel by working with the GDP sheet of the Wealth of Nations Excel dataset. This project includes additional Excel functions, such as creating macro buttons, integrating with Microsoft Word, adding headers and footers, and managing files.

## Project Functions

1. **Create Macro Buttons:** I added three macro buttons to the sheet for various tasks - printing the sheet, saving the file, and copying the sheet. For copying, I used a macro to highlight the area to be copied and assigned it to the copy button.

2. **Copy the Sheet to a New Word Document:** Using the copy macro, I copied the sheet and pasted it into a new Word document while preserving the formatting. I titled the page 'GDP (Gross domestic product)'.

3. **Save Word Document:** I saved the Word document as 'Word Gross domestic product report 1'.

4. **Add Headers and Footers:** I added headers and footers to the Excel table. To do this, I selected the 'View' tab and chose the 'Page Layout' icon. I entered my name and 'GLA DATA 1' in the header and today's date, 'Assignment 1', and 'Data Visualization' in the footer.
